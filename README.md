### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

  I am Ryan Cabrera (not the musician) and am currently as of 1/16/2024 a highschool sophomore. I am very passionate about technology and will pursue a higher education where I can learn more about it.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently in a game development program that teaches me how to create games on unity and how to code with C#.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about machine learning, game design, networking, C#, and java. 
- âœ”  Goals: I will make some projects using machine learning and game design. During the summer I plan to join an internship program during the summer that will teach me skills I will use in the future.
    I want to make a game with a few teammates that will improve my skills in coding and unity. 
- âš¡ Future aspirations: Graduate college with a CS degree. I want to become a software developer for a big company such as google or microsoft.
