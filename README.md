### Hi there 👋

**Ryan-Cabrera/Ryan-Cabrera** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
  I am Ryan Cabrera (not the musician) and am currently as of 1/16/2024 a highschool sophomore. I am very passionate about technology and will persue a higher education where I can learn more about it.

- 🔭 I’m currently in a game development program that teaches me how to create games on unity and how to code with C#.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about machine learning, game design, networking, C#, and java. 
- ✔  Goals: I will make some projects using machine learning and game design. During the summer I plan to join an internship program during the summer that will teach me skills I will use in the future.
    I want to make a game with a few teammates that will improve my skills in coding and unity. 
- ⚡ Future aspirations: Graduate colledge with a CS degree. I want to become a software developer for a big company such as google or microsoft
